# -Comparing-Database-Options-for-a-Web-Application-Taggit-

This project aims to find the most appropriate database for a web application. Database is very essential for quick storage and retrieval of information in any application. The paper concentrates on calculating the average time required to insert and fetch data by each database. The two databases used in the experiment are PostgreSQL relational database and MongoDB noSql database. The paper looks into the requirement of the application and thus decide the best database for it. Using two completely different databases adds to the clarity of the results. The paper also looks into indexing and implements Apache Lucene with each of the databases. The results were quiet predictable, MongoDB with Lucene faired the best.
